## 🧠 The Problem

Traditional text is often dense, overwhelming, and inaccessible. For students, professionals, and learners with conditions like ADHD or autism, long articles or complex papers create a significant barrier to understanding. Simply "reading" doesn't mean "learning."

## ✨ The Solution

**Clarify** is an AI-powered reading assistant that transforms any text into an interactive, simple, and accessible learning experience. It's not just a reader; it's an interpreter. It decodes complexity so you can focus on what matters.
